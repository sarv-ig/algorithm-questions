# Question

we have a string text and bunch of  words or letters

find all sequence of words that create string text

example:

words = { this, is, sarv, group,s,sa,sar,arv,rv,v };
text = thisissarvgroup
Output:
this is sarv group
this is s arv group
this is sa rv group
this is sar v group

the words and text are both input of our program
we don't know in the text which word can be write with space
we should find words from word object that can fit in text with space
